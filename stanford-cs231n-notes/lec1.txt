CS231n - Lec. 1 - Notes

Keywords:
- CVPR / ICC-V = big compVis confereces
- Segmentation (Perceptual Grouping)
- Motion and Affordance
- Img Classification
- Obj Detection vs Img Captioning vs Img Recognition vs Action Classifi.
- Models: [AlexNet, LeNet, VGG, MSRA]

High Level Topics:
- History CompVis Field (edges --> 3d reconstr. ['00 forked] --> img recog. --> '12 CNNs post imgNet challg. [img classification])
- CNNs are not a new invention, backprop was solved a while ago. The key is Moore's Law and the now massive amount of data available.
- CompVis is an ongoing active area of R&D. The holy grai is generating a 'story' of what the image is capturing. Humans can write essays on an img they are shown for only 500ms...



QUICK HISTORY OF COMPUTER VISION: -----------------------------------------
- Cat primary visual cortex neuroscience, bar orientation tuning neurons
- Block World - Larry Roberts '63 edge detection
- '66 Marvin Minsky MIT AI lab, vision
- Vision by David Marr '70s (took hierarchical approach)
	+ input img --> edges (primal sketch) --> 2 1/2 d sketch --> 3d
- Brooks & Binford '79 - Generalized Cylinder Model
- Fischler & Elschlager '73 - Pictorial Structure
- David Lowe '87 - Edge Detection and simple shapes to detect objects
	       ########## END Ancient World of CompVis ##########
- Normalized Cut by Shi & Malik '97 - 1st research to use RL imgs
	+ perceptual grouping (problem still not solved...)
- SIFT & Object Recog by David Lowe '99
	+ Recognize objects via small learned features (engineered features)
- Face Detection by Viola & Jones '01
	+ First high level visual detection algo to be used commercially
- Computer Vision forked 2 paths 3d reconstr. into visual object recog.
- Spatial Pyramid Matching by Lazebnik Schmid & Ponce '06 (scene recog.)
- Dalal & Triggs '05 Histogram of Gradients (kernel trick for recog.)
- Falzenswalb & McAllester '09
	  ###### CompVis Working on Hard Problems (not contrived)  #######
- PASCAL Visual Object Challange (20 objs) '12
	+ 10ks of imgs. Performance increasing through labs.
- ImageNet (22k categories 15 million imgs) (mechanical Turk) '10 - '14
	+ 1.5 million set over 1k objs (olympics of computer vsion)
	+ Error rate decrease over year. 2012 error rate cut in half by CNN
	+ CNNs not new, created decades ago, 2012 ushered in new era of DL.
- Massive Research into the field of Deep NNs and CNN for image recog.
--------------------------------- -END- ------------------------------------



QUICK HISTORY OF ImageNet Challange: ---------------------------------------
- 2010 NEC-UIUC - notCNN
- 2012 SuperVision - Krisvensky & Hinton - CNN
- 2014 GoogLeNet & VGG - both CNN
- 2015 MSRA (Microsoft research RN) CNN
--------------------------------- -END- ------------------------------------



QUICK HISTORY OF CNNs: -----------------------------------------------------
- Kunihiko Fukushima build neo-cognitron (basis of CNNs model ~kinda)
- LeCun & Hinton '98 ground breaking work on backpropegation algorithm
	+ Bells labs where he built model to detect digits
- Krizhevsky & Hinton '12 winning imageNet architecture (moores law - GPUs) & (sigmoid --> ReLU) Model was much larger in '12 vs. '98 This coupled with More massive data sets was key!
- Ongong R&D beyond image classification (tell a story of a scene...)
